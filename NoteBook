Project Name -Tutorial
	In my project I have used django technology based on python. My project works on MVT architecture.
On home page of my project User can see Welcome-Message and Two Options Login for existing user and register for new users. 
I have used a function to validate the username and Email-Id if user name/Email-Id already exists then the user will be notified with a message and if user registered successfully, User will be redirected to the login page.
After login successful to my Tutorial project there are five buttons Tutorials, About Us, New tutorial and Logout.
